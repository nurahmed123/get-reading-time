# Text Analysis Tool

A simple text analysis tool that provides insights into text such as reading time, word count, sentiment, readability score, link count, and SEO-friendly keywords.

## Features

- **Reading Time**: Estimates how long it will take to read the given text based on a default or custom reading speed (words per minute).
- **Word Count**: Counts the number of words in the text.
- **Character Count**: Counts the number of characters (excluding spaces) in the text.
- **Sentence Count**: Counts the number of sentences based on punctuation marks.
- **Link Count**: Detects and counts the number of URLs in the text.
- **Readability Score**: Calculates the Flesch Reading Ease score to evaluate the text's readability.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the sentiment of the text (Positive, Negative, or Neutral).
- **SEO-friendly Keywords**: Extracts the top 5 SEO-friendly keywords or key phrases (bi-grams and tri-grams) from the text.
- **aiTexGen**: Allows users to generate content based on a search prompt using the Cohere AI API, with a specified word count.
- **Automatic Punctuation and Capitalization**: Automatically adds proper punctuation and capitalizes the beginning of sentences in a provided text.

## Installation

To install the package from npm, run:

```bash
npm i get-reading-time
```

Or using yarn:

```bash
yarn add get-reading-time
```

## Usage

Hereâ€™s how you can use the analyzeText function to analyze a piece of text:

```bash
import { analyzeText } from "get-reading-time/dist/index.js";
```

### Example Code

```javascript
const text = `This is an example of text. It contains words, sentences, and links like there are https://linkedin.com/in/06nurahmed https://github.com/nurahmed123`;

const result = analyzeText(text);

// Analyze the text
try {
  const result = analyzeText(text);

  // Output the analysis results
  console.log("Text Analysis Result:");
  console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));
} catch (error) {
  // Narrow the type of error to Error
  if (error instanceof Error) {
    console.error("Error analyzing text:", error.message);
  } else {
    console.error("Unknown error:", error);
  }
}
```

### Example Output

```json
{
  "readingTime": {
    "minutes": 0.09,
    "seconds": 5.1
  },
  "wordCount": 17,
  "characterCount": 132,
  "sentenceCount": 3,
  "linkCount": 2,
  "links": [
    "https://linkedin.com/in/06nurahmed",
    "https://github.com/nurahmed123"
  ],
  "readabilityScore": 21.93039215686275,
  "sentiment": "Neutral",
  "keywords": ["example", "text.", "contains", "words,", "sentences,"]
}
```

### aiTexGen: Generate your content
This new feature allows users to generate content using Cohere AI. You provide your Cohere API key, a search prompt, and a word count, and it will return the generated content.

### Usage
To use the **aiTexGen** feature, follow these steps:
```bash
import { aiTexGen } from "get-reading-time/dist/index.js";
```

### Example Code
- Create your [Api key](https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys) From here.
```javascript
// Replace this with your Cohere API key
const apiKey = '<api-key>';
const generator = new aiTexGen(apiKey);

async function testGenerateContent() {
    try {
        // Define a topic and word count for testing
        const topic = 'arduino';
        const wordCount = 100;

        // Call the generateContent method
        const result = await generator.generateContent(topic, wordCount);

        // Output the result in JSON format
        console.log('Generated Content (JSON Format):');
        console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2)); // Pretty print the JSON output

    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error during content generation:', error);
    }
}
// Run the test
testGenerateContent();
```
### Example Output
```json
{
  "topic": "arduino",
  "content": "Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It's designed to make interactive projects accessible to everyone, from artists and designers to hobbyists and engineers. \n\nAt the heart of the Arduino platform is the Arduino board, a simple microcontroller board that can read inputs and turn them into outputs, such as turning on an LED light or activating a motor. \n\nWhat makes Arduino unique is its user-friendly approach, with a simplified programming language and easy-to-use hardware, making it a popular choice for beginners and professionals alike. With its versatility and robust community support, Arduino has become a go-to platform for creating interactive, sensor-based projects and prototypes."
}
```

### Automatic Punctuation and Capitalization

You can now pass an article to the `analyzeText` function, and it will automatically fix punctuation and capitalize the first letter of sentences. This feature helps to improve the readability of raw text.

#### Example Code
Import the package and follow the steps: 
```javascript
import { getPunch } from 'get-reading-time/dist/index.js';
```

```javascript
// Example to test with a string
const content = "once a lion a fox and a wolf went hunting they ultimately spotted a stag and killed him for their food while sharing the hunt quarter me this stag roared the lion and other animals skinned and cut the spoil into four equal parts";
async function GetPunch() {
    try {
        // Call the getPunch function with content
        const result = await getPunch(content);

        // Check the result and log it as a formatted JSON response
        if (result.status_code === 200) {
            console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));
        } else {
            console.error("Error:", JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));
        }
    } catch (error) {
        // Handle unexpected errors
        console.error("Unexpected Error:", error);
    }
}
// Run the test
GetPunch();
```

### Example Output
```json
{
  "content": "Once a Lion, a Fox and a Wolf went hunting, they ultimately found a stag and killed him for their food while sharing the hunt quarter me. This stag roared the Lion and other animals skinned and cut the spoil into four equal parts.",
  "status_code": 200
}
```
